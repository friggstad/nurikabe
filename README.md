# nurikabe
A nurikabe solver I worked on while bored during the pandemic.

Compile with "make"

Run with
./nurikabe <filename> [--step]

The filename is the .txt file encoding an instance (see the examples included).
The argument --step is optional and will cause the program to wait for
the user to enter "return" after each new character is added to the solution.
